# Better Errors - with Sublime Text 2 support

This fork of [`better_errors`](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors), simply replaces all mentioning of filenames with links to that file in Sublime Text 2.

In order to get this working, you will have to install [`subl-handler`](https://github.com/asuth/subl-handler) as well.
